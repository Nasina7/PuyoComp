# PuyoComp
This is a bit-perfect compressor / decompressor for the compression format used in Puyo Puyo on the Sega Megadrive.
## Note
Although this has been tested with all of the art files in Puyo Puyo 1, I haven't tested this with any files from Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, although it should be bit-perfect for those files as well.
